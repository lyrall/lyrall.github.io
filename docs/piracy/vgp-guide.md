# Video Game Piracy Guide

## Content

## Required Reading
- Check out my [Internet Privacy & Safety Guide](ips-guide.md) and [Basic Pirate Literacy Guide](bpl-guide.md) FIRST, it'll help you a lot. If there is a term you don't understand here, I have likely explained it in those prerequisite guides.
- As with the rest of these guides, this will be very Windows 10 oriented. 
- Pirating video games is both more technical and more dangerous than pirating any other form of media. If you want anything from this guide done but are overwhelmed, I suggest you ask me directly for help.
