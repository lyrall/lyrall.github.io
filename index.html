  <h2>Early Life</h2>  
    
    <p>John Bosco, also known as Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco and Don Bosco, was born in Becchi, Italy, on August 16, 1815. He and his two older brothers were left by their father to be raised by his mother, Margherita. John attended church and became very devout. When he was not in church, he helped his family grow food and raise sheep. As a boy, John studied and learned how to perform the tricks of a traveling troupe of circus performers. On Sunday evenings, John staged shows for neighborhood kids, at the end of which, he recited the homily he heard earlier in church. During this time, John discerned the call to become a priest. John's older brother became angry at this apparent disloyalty. He was only 12 when he left home to work, a decision hastened by his brother's hostility. He worked for two years before he met Jospeh Cafasso, a priest who was willing to help and educate him. In 1835, John entered the seminary and following six years of study and preparation, he was ordained a priest in 1841.</p>  
      
  <h2>Priesthood</h2>  
    
    <p>His first assignment was to Turin, where poverty was widespread. In these poor neighborhoods John went to work with the children of the poor. He noticed many boys between the ages of 12 and 18 in the prisons. The conditions were deplorable, and he felt moved to do more to prevent other boys from ending up there. He went into the streets, doing tricks to capture attention, then sharing with the children his message for the day. When he was not preaching, Bosco seeked work and lodging for those who needed it. His mother began to help him, and she became known as "Mamma Margherita." Bosco also negotiated new rights for boys who were employed as apprentices. The boys he hired out were given feast days off, could no longer be beaten, and could not be forced to do menial, un-apprenticeship related labor.</p>
