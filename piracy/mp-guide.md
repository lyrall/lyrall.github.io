## Required Reading

- Check out my [Internet Privacy & Safety Guide](ips-guide.md) and [Basic Pirate Literacy Guide](bpl-guide.md) FIRST, it'll help you a lot. If there is a term you don't understand here, I have likely explained it in those prerequisite guides.
- As with the rest of these guides, this will be very Windows 10 oriented. 
- "Tags" are descriptors attatched to audio files, to provide more info on them. Some examples of tags would be the ```year``` and ```artist``` of an album. 
- This is not important information but you should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMZ4kkSVrBw&list=LL1Z2g1X7o2f6RYOIzyR_1UA&index=547) about music piracy history, I thought it was funny.

## Deemix

There are a lot of legacy methods of pirating music, which served their purposes. Ripping from youtube music videos, torrenting albums with Limewire, etc. Please, do not do any of those things. Though this method could become obsolete at a moment's notice, there is currently a singular superior way to pirate music, and that is Deemix. 

Deemix is a download manager, allowing you to download music files from Deezer's servers. Deezer is a music streaming service, much like Spotify. But unlike Spotify, their security is poor enough that smart people were able to create Deemix. If an application tells you it can do the same with Spotify, it is lying to you. This is the current superior way to pirate music, because downloading from an official music streaming service provides high quality music with all the correct tags and album art.

## Installation

1. Go to the [Deezer website](www.deezer.com), create an account, and sign in.
    - I recommend using a fake email and name. Use [temp-mail](temp-mail.org) for a throwaway email.
2. Once signed in, stay on that page and click the lock symbol ```üîí``` that's on the right of the url.
3. Click ```Cookies```. 
4. Within the pop-up, click the arrow next ```deezer.com```.
5. Click the arrow next to the folder icon labeled ```Cookies```.
6. Scroll down the list and find ```arl```, select it.
7. There should be a few values with Name, Content, Domain, and Path labels. Copy the long line of letters and numbers next to Content.
8. Paste this in a note-keeping app somewhere, you'll need it later.
9. [Download Deemix](), it is packaged in a zip folder.
10. Unzip the zip folder you just downloaded into a new folder, and name it Deemix.
    - It doesn't matter where your new Deemix folder is located, as long as it is a newly created folder. I prefer to keep my Deemix folder in the "Program Files" folder on my computer.
11. Optionally, open the Deemix folder and right click on ```deemix_gui.exe``` (this is the app itself), and then click ```Create shortcut```. Drag and drop your newly created shortcut onto your desktop for easy access. Alternatively, right click ```deemix_gui.exe``` and click ```Pin to Start``` For another shortcut.

## Configuration

Deemix needs to be configured a little before you start using it. First, upon first launching the app, go to the settings and paste your ```arl``` code into a box, allowing Deemix to access Deezer servers. After that, there are various settings you will want to look over. **I highly recommend these ones. Setting options I do not mention are insignificant, but I do not recommend changing the defaults.**  

- **Download Path**: Type ```C:\Users\[youraccount]\Music``` into the box, but replace ```[youraccount``` with the username for you computer. If somehow you don't know your computer username, pressing the Windows button and then clicking the profile button ```üë§``` will display your username.
- **Trackname template**: Type ```%artist% - %title%``` into the box.
- **Album track template**: Type ```%tracknumber% - %title%``` into the box.
- **Playlist track template**: Type ```%position% - %title% - %artist%``` into the box.
- **Create folders for playlist**: Check ```‚òëÔ∏è```.
- **Create folders for artist**: Do not check```‚¨ú```.
- **Create folders for CD**: Check ```‚òëÔ∏è```.
- **Create folder structures for playlist**: Check ```‚òëÔ∏è```.
- **Create folder structures for singles**: Check ```‚òëÔ∏è```.
- **Pad tracks**: Do not check```‚¨ú```.
- **Illegal Character replacer**: Keep this box BLANK, delete anything inside of it.
- **Prefered Bitrate**: Select ```MP3 320kbps``` if you have limited storage space on your computer/phone, select ```FLAC 1411kbps``` if you have more storage space, and want higher quality. ```MP3 320kbps``` is still excellent quality, just not the excessive quality of ```FLAC 1411kbps```.

## Alternative Methods

If for some reason you don't want to use Deemix (even though there plainly is NOT a better way to pirate music at this moment in time), there are still a few other methods I can hesitantly recommend.
