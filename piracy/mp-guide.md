# Music Piracy Guide

## Required Reading

- Check out my [Internet Privacy & Safety Guide](ips-guide.md) and [Basic Pirate Literacyy Guide](bpl-guide.md) FIRST, it'll help you a lot. If there is a term you don't understand here, I have likely explained it in those prerequisite guides.
- As with the rest of these guides, this will be very Windows 10 oriented. 
- "Tags" are descriptors attatched to audio files, to provide more info on them. Some examples of tags would be the ```year``` and ```artist``` of an album. 
- This is not important information but you should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMZ4kkSVrBw&list=LL1Z2g1X7o2f6RYOIzyR_1UA&index=547) about music piracy history, I thought it was funny.

## Deemix

There are a lot of legacy methods of pirating music, which served their purposes. Ripping from youtube music videos, torrenting albums with Limewire, etc. Please, do not do any of those things. Though this method could become obsolete at a moment's notice, there is currently a singular superior way to pirate music, and that is Deemix. 

Deemix is a download manager, allowing you to download music files from Deezer's servers. Deezer is a music streaming service, much like Spotify. But unlike Spotify, their security is poor enough that smart people were able to create Deemix. If an application tells you it can do the same with Spotify, it is lying to you. This is the current superior way to pirate music, because downloading from an official music streaming service provides high quality music with all the correct tags and album art.

## Installation

1. Go to the [Deezer website](www.deezer.com), create an account, and sign in.
    - I recommend using a fake email and name. Use [temp-mail](temp-mail.org) for a throwaway email.
2. Once signed in, stay on that page and click the lock symbol ```ðŸ”’``` that's on the right of the url.
3. Click ```Cookies```. 


## Configuration

Deemix needs to be configured a little before you start using it. First, upon first launching the app, you'll be prompted to paste your ```arl``` code into a box, allowing Deemix to access Deezer servers.
