# The Layman's Guide to Piracy

There are enumerable methods, tools, guides, and masterlists for piracy floating around the web. But resources that are either not detailed enough, or are overwhelmingly comprehensive, are each inaccessible to young pirates. This is an attempt at a middle ground. Detailed enough that the tech-illiterate but determined can follow along, but only containing what you need to start pirating. These guides were written with the average person (who may only be interested in occasionally pirating specific things), and beginning pirates in mind. 

If you've read/followed these guides any number of times and can repeat them confidently, you should now have basic skills and understanding that will be useful for other methods of piracy. Though not necessary to simply get the job done, there is much more to piracy than what is laid out on this site. Here are a few extremely comprehensive resources if you're ready to move past the guides on this site:
