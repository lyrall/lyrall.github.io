rundown of everything in this repository

## gba

A folder containing the emulator core, ROMS, and launcher for a functional, in-browser Game Boy Advance emulator. Though an in-browser GBA emulator is something cool enough to share with other people on it's own, the end goal in forking this emulator over to my repository is having an easy way to share my games with other people. 

### Iodine GBA

[Iodine GBA](https://github.com/taisel/IodineGBA) relinquished their copyright of the emulator in the README of Iodine GBA's repository. I am choosing to credit them rather than the "devs" I got the launcher file from, because they were falsely claiming the emulator to be their own. In reality, they only contributed in small part to a launcher file which links specific games to the emulator, so that end-users do not have to find their own ROMs.

## piracy

Contains a series of guides on how to pirate, written in Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup langauge, that allows you to quickly format text so that it is organized and readable. The text you are reading right now is formatted with Markdown. While they are still in progress, in the end there will be 5 pirate guides: Basic Pirate Literacy, Internet Safety & Privacy, Movies/TV, Video Games, and Music. I wrote them for the tech-illiterate in mind, so they should be accessible to anyone willing to put in the effort. Soon enough, I will learn how to use Jekyll. I'm not entirely sure what it is, but I know that using it with this repository's Github Pages site will allow my Markdown files to be readable on the site, not just within the repository. And that I will be able to add themes so you can read them in darkmode :D
