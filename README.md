## Iodine GBA

[Iodine GBA](https://github.com/taisel/IodineGBA) relinquished their copyright of the emulator in the README of Iodine GBA's repository. I am choosing to credit them rather than the "devs" I got the launcher file from, because they were falsely claiming the emulator to be their own. In reality, they only contributed a launcher file which links specific games to the emulator so that end-user did not have to find their own ROMs.
