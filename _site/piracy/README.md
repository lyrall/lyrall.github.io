# r2300 Guide to Piracy

There are innumerable methods, tools, guides, and masterlists for piracy floating around the web. While helpful, these often come in the form of long, comprehensive lists that cite resources beginner pirates don't know how to take advanage of. And so these guides are written with beginner pirates in mind. This will not be a long list of resources, but rather a write-up that will explain essential piracy skills and knowledge. Detailed enough that the tech-illiterate but determined can follow along, but only containing what you need to start pirating. It should help anyone wanting to start pirating, or even average people who only want to pirate occasionally for specific things.

By the time you start feeling comfortable with the contents of these guides, you'll probably have enough knowledge and instruction-following skills to begin exploring everything the pirate community has to offer. Here are a few extremely comprehensive resources to get you started:
  - [r/Piracy wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/index)
  - [WAREZZ](https://warezz.now.sh/)
  - [Igglybuff's awesome-piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy)
