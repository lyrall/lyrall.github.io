# Movies and TV Piracy Guide

## Required Reading

- Please read the [Internet Privacy & Safety Guide](ips-guide.md) before using this guide.
- It is not necessary, but if you are particurally tech illiterate, I recommend you also read my [Basic Pirate Literacy Guide](bpl-guide.md).
- As with the rest of these guides, this will be very Windows 10 oriented. 

## Streaming

For the masses, the most appealing method of pirating movies and TV is streaming. It's easier, and doesn't take up the storage space and time that downloads do. Most sites that advertise themselves as pirate streaming sites are illegitimate, and are trying to scam you into downloading malware or giving them your bank credentials. I have waded through the garbage and offer to you what I currently know as the best pirate streaming sites. Still, PLEASE use an ad blocker, and check out my [IPS Guide](ips-guide.md) for my recommendation.
