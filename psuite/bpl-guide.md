# Basic Pirate Literacy Guide

This guide will be explaining a few processes that will increase your overall computer literacy, as would be useful specifically for piracy. I'll explain terminology, file management, and transferable pirate skills. 

## Important Notes

- As with the rest of these guides, this will be very Windows 10 oriented. 
- If you feel pretty comfortable with everything across all my guides, you should check out these comprehensive collections of pirate resources:
    - [r/Piracy wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/index)
    - [Igglybuff's awesome-piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy)   

## File Extensions

File extensions are a label at the end of all file names, which mark what type of file one is. They consist of a ```.```, followed by an abbreviation for the type of file.

File name WITHOUT visible file extension | File name WITH visibile file extension | File Type | Media Type
-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------
spongebobsquarepants-s03e19 | spongebobsquarepants-s03e19.mkv | Matroska Multimedia Container | Video
august.taylorswift | august.taylorswift.flac | Free Lossless Audio Codec | Audio

As you can observe from these examples, a file extention always starts with a ```.```, and the example file extensions are ```.mkv ``` and ```.flac```. The presence of a ```.``` earlier in the file name, like in the second example, does not effect the file extension. 

### Show File Extensions

By default, Windows' File Explorer does not display file extensions. To enable this:

1. Open File Explorer.
2. Click the ```View``` tab at the top.
3. Check the box next to ```Show file extensions```.

## Zip Folders

You will encounter zip folders A LOT as a pirate. File archiving, or "zipping" is when a group of files is compressed into a single file, so that they can be stored and transferred as one. File systems treat zip folders as singular files, despite their name. That is, until they are unzipped and the contained files are seperated again.

The common types of zip folders can be indentified by their file extension.

Common Types of Zip Folder | Source
----------------------|------
.zip | Default on Most Operating Systems
.rar | Created by WinRAR
.7z | Free and Open Source

### 7zip



## IP Address

An IP address is very similar to a regular postal address. While a postal address labels where a location is in the world, an IP address labels "where" a computer is on the internet. It is a means by which computers identify and communicate with one another. An example of what an IP Address looks like is ```216.3. 128.12```, or ```209.43.71.34```. 

## File Hosters

File hosters have many names, such as cloud service, cloud, cloud hoster, file sharer, file sharing site, P2P site, etc. Any variation of these things is referring to the same thing, a service that stores files on their own computers, that can be accessed from anywhere. Because these file hosters allow users to not only store, but share files with others, they are used to by pirates to share content. The most well known example is Google Drive, other contendors being Onedrive, Box, Dropbox, Mediafire, etc. 

### MEGA

[MEGA](https://mega.nz) is the most popular file hoster among more experienced pirates. This is becaue of MEGA's end-to-end encryption, which means that no one can access stored content except for those with the link key. This secure-by-design security restricts even the MEGA company themselves from seeing your files, meaning that pirated content is much less likely to be discovered and removed from the site. Many of the tools, methods, and sites I reference through these guides will use MEGA, and so you should have some understanding of it specifically. 

A mega link, or link key, is a url that contains the key for a file or folder stored on MEGA. 

An example: ```https://mega.nz/folder/ObokBahB#8y4EKrQLVScGSx8WUitvpQ``` 

#### MegaDownloader

MegaDownloader is a download manager for MEGA. It is generally faster than downloading in-browser, and allows you to easily bypass download restrictions. Use is simple:

1. Download [MegaDownloader](), you can place it anywhere on your computer.
2. Open ```MegaDownloader.exe```.
    - Upon launching MegaDownloader for the first time, a settings menu will pop up. Click cancel in the lower right corner, as the default settings do not need to be touched.
3. Click the ```+``` button.
4. Paste the mega link into the box by pressing ```ctrl + v```.
    - You can add multiple links at once, just press ```Enter``` and paste again.
5. Click ```Browse``` and select where on your computer you want to place your downloads.
6. ```Start download``` and ```Create directory``` are enabled by default. I recommend keeping it that way.
7. Click ```Add links```.

#### Bypass MEGA download restrictions with MegaDownloader and a VPN

Should you be using MegaDownloader and your download comes to a hault, it is likely because MEGA has temporarily restricted downloads for your computer. They are able to identify you and your excess downloads by your IP address. To bypass this, you need to make your IP address appear different, which is the function of a VPN. Check out my [IPS Guide](ips-guide.md) for more info about VPNs and my recommendations/warnings concerning them.
