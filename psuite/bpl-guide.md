# Basic Pirate Literacy Guide

This guide will be explaining a few processes that will increase your overall computer literacy, as would be useful specifically for piracy. I'll explain terminology, file management, and transferable pirate skills. 

## Extended Resources

What I offer here should give a basic understanding of how to access whatever content a pirate wants. For those comfortable with everything I describe across these guides, I recommend checking out these comprehensive lists of pirate resources:
- [r/Piracy wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/index)

## File Hosters

File hosters have many names, such as cloud service, cloud, cloud hoster, file sharer, file sharing site, P2P site, etc. Any variation of these things is referring to the same thing, a service that stores files on their own computers, that can be accessed from anywhere. Because these file hosters allow users to not only store, but share files with others, they are used to by pirates to share content. The most well known example is Google Drive, other contendors being Onedrive, Box, Dropbox, Mediafire, etc. 

### MEGA

[MEGA](https://mega.nz) is the most popular file hoster among more experienced pirates. This is becaue of MEGA's end to end encryption, which means that no one can access stored content except for those with the link key. This secure-by-design security restricts even the MEGA company themselves from seeing your files, meaning that pirated content is much less likely to be discovered and removed from the site. Many of the tools, methods, and sites I reference through these guides will use MEGA, and so you should have some understanding of it specifically. 

A mega link, or link key, is a url that contains the key for a file or folder stored on MEGA. 

An example: ```https://mega.nz/folder/ObokBahB#8y4EKrQLVScGSx8WUitvpQ```

#### Megadownloader

Megadownloader is a download manager for MEGA. It is generally faster than downloading in-browser, and allows you to easily bypass download restrictions. Use is simple:

1. Download [Megadownloader](), you can place it anywhere on your computer.
2. Launch ```Megadownloader.exe```.
3. Click the ```+``` button.
4. Paste the 

## File Extensions

File extensions are a label at the end of all file names, which mark what type of file one is. They 

File name WITHOUT visible file extension | File name WITH visibile file extension
-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------
spongebobsquarepants-s03e19 | spongebobsquarepants-s03e19.mkv
august.taylorswift | august.taylorswift.flac

As you can observe from these examples, a file extention always starts with a ```.```, and the example file extensions are ```.mkv ``` and ```.flac```. The presence of a ```.``` earlier in the file name, like in the second example, does not effect the file extension.
